# AI Workflow Integration Guide for IndieDevHQ

Comprehensive AI workflow practices aligned across all IndieDevHQ sections for maximum development efficiency.

## Overview

This guide consolidates AI workflow practices from across the IndieDevHQ methodology, creating a unified approach to AI-augmented development that works seamlessly with all project types and tools.

## Unified AI Integration Philosophy

### **Core AI Workflow Principles**

**Multi-Model Strategy**:
- **Strategic AI** (Claude/ChatGPT): Architecture, planning, complex problem-solving
- **Code AI** (Cursor/GitHub Copilot): Implementation, refactoring, debugging
- **Local AI** (LM Studio): Privacy-sensitive tasks, offline development
- **Specialized AI**: Domain-specific tasks (documentation, testing, deployment)

**Context Management**:
- **CLAUDE.md files**: Provide project-specific AI context
- **System prompts**: Specialized AI assistants (Jenny, Jeff) for consistent interactions
- **Documentation-first**: AI-parseable knowledge base for better assistance
- **Conversation continuity**: Structured approaches to maintain context across sessions

## AI Workflow Across Project Types

### **Tauri Projects + AI**

```bash
# Project initialization with AI context
./scripts/init-project.sh my-tauri-app tauri .

# AI-enhanced development workflow
# 1. Architecture planning with Claude/ChatGPT
# 2. Code implementation with Cursor/Copilot
# 3. Rust backend development with AI assistance
# 4. Frontend development with AI UI generation
```

**AI Prompts for Tauri**:
```
Context: Tauri desktop application with Rust backend
Task: [Describe specific task]

Architecture: [Reference CLAUDE.md for project details]
```

### **Swift Projects + AI**

```bash
# Swift project with AI integration
./scripts/init-project.sh my-swift-app swift .

# AI workflow for Swift development
# 1. Swift architecture design with AI
# 2. Package.swift dependency recommendations
# 3. SwiftUI/UIKit implementation assistance
# 4. Testing strategy with AI-generated tests
```

**AI Prompts for Swift**:
```
Context: Swift console/iOS application for Apple ecosystem
Task: [Specific Swift task]
Constraints: Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Swift best practices
Integration: CommandLineInterface, SwiftUI, Core Data as needed
```

### **Web Projects + AI**

```bash
