Here’s a **detailed summary** of this conversation, structured to help you reflect, revise, and evolve your documentation and AI workflow strategy.

## ✅ **Conversation Summary: User Stories as Prompts & Integration Strategy**

### 🧠 Goal Clarification:

You want a minimal yet powerful document structure to guide AI-assisted software development. Your aim is to:

- Use structured docs to give context to an IDE-based AI (like Cursor, Kiro, or Copilot)
    
- Avoid excessive or bloated documentation
    
- Leverage user stories as a dual-purpose format: task + prompt
    

---

### 📄 Core Documents Identified:

You asked for the **"official names"** of standard software documentation. Here's what we agreed upon:

|Purpose|Standard Doc Name|
|---|---|
|Define what to build|Requirements Document (PRD)|
|High-level design|Architecture Document|
|Implementation details|Technical Specification|
|Timeline & goals|Roadmap|

**Supporting docs** may include: README, User Stories, Test Plan, API Spec, and Vision Doc.

You expressed interest in **lightweight documents**—enough to give an LLM structure, but not overwhelm or waste tokens.

### 💡 User Stories as AI Prompts

You proposed using **user stories directly as prompts**, and we agreed this is:

- **Highly efficient** for solo + AI dev flow
    
- **Natural language-friendly** (great for GPT-based models)
    
- **Easy to maintain** (can live in `user_stories.md`)
    
- **Dual-purpose** as both task + documentation
    

Example transformation:

> **User Story**:  
> _As a user, I want to flash a USB with an ISO so that I can install KilnOS._

→ Feed directly to IDE AI, or add minimal prompt glue like:

> _"Implement this in Rust using Tauri, assume ISO is downloaded locally."_

### 🔁 Integration Into Broader Strategy

We mapped how **user stories-as-prompts** fit into your full-stack solo dev approach:

|Layer|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|High-level planning|Apple Reminders|30k foot view across multiple projects|
|Task tracking|GitHub Projects + Issues|Per-repo development management|
|Source of truth|`user_stories.md`|Version-controlled AI prompt base|
|Implementation|IDE AI tools (Kiro, etc.)|Story → prompt → code/tests/docs|

You noted that Apple Reminders is now your kanban-style personal planner, while GitHub Projects can be your repo-scoped dev dashboard.

### 🛠 Script Automation Proposal

You proposed a refinement:

> _"What if we generate user stories, then script the GitHub CLI to create issues from them, allowing me to use GitHub Projects as normal?"_

We explored and validated this idea:

- Retains local versioned source (`user_stories.md`)
    
- Enables AI-native workflows _and_ GitHub-native tracking
    
- Keeps single-source clarity while allowing automation
    

I offered to write a simple Bash script to parse stories and create GitHub issues via `gh issue create`, along with a robust Markdown format that can evolve (with status, tags, etc.).

### ✅ Final Alignment

This new system is:

- Lean
    
- AI-native
    
- GitHub-compatible
    
- Solo-dev optimized
    
- Token-efficient
    
- Extendable

## 🔮 Suggested Next Steps

You may want to:

1. ✅ Finalize your `user_stories.md` format (want a template?)
    
2. 🛠 Create and test the `gh` CLI automation script
    
3. 💼 Link GitHub Projects to AI workflows (e.g., labeling stories that are “AI-ready”)
    
4. 🔁 Optionally build a feedback loop: AI results get linked back to their source story

Would you like me to roll all this into a working v1 setup: a file structure, sample story doc, and CLI script?
