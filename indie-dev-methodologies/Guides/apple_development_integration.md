# Apple Development Integration for IndieDevHQ

Comprehensive Apple ecosystem development methodology integrated with IndieDevHQ automation and workflows.

## Overview

**Philosophy**: Deep integration with Apple ecosystem for focused, productive development  
**Integration**: Works seamlessly with IndieDevHQ scripts and templates  
**Focus**: macOS-first development with cross-platform considerations

## Apple Development Methodology

### **Why Apple-Only Development Works**

**Deep Integration Benefits**:
- Apple tools work seamlessly together  
- UI/UX mastery requires ecosystem understanding
- Reduced tool-hopping and decision fatigue
- Career alignment with Apple platform requirements

**Productivity Philosophy**:
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Choose tools that reduce overhead
- **Results Over Hype**: Focus on what works, not trends
- **Consistency Over Perfection**: Ship products rather than perfect plans

## Swift Console Applications

### **Quick Start with IndieDevHQ Integration**

Use IndieDevHQ automation for Swift projects:

```bash
# Initialize Swift console app with IndieDevHQ
./scripts/init-project.sh MySwiftApp swift ~/Projects

# Enhanced Swift setup (manual steps)
cd ~/Projects/MySwiftApp
swift package init --type executable --name MySwiftApp
```

### **Project Structure**
```
MySwiftApp/
├── Package.swift
├── Sources/
│   └── MySwiftApp/
│       └── main.swift
├── Tests/
│   └── MySwiftAppTests/
├── README.md         # Generated by IndieDevHQ
├── CLAUDE.md         # Generated by IndieDevHQ  
└── .github/          # Generated by IndieDevHQ
    ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    └── workflows/
```

### **Build & Development Workflow**

```bash
# Build and run
swift build
swift run

# Test
swift test

# IndieDevHQ integration
./scripts/check-conformity.sh .        # Validate project structure
./scripts/generate-docs.py .           # Generate documentation
```

### **Dependencies Management**

Edit `Package.swift` for common Swift dependencies:

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.2.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-log", from: "1.0.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MySwiftApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser"),
            .product(name: "Logging", package: "swift-log")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Enhanced Project Initialization Script

Let's enhance the IndieDevHQ init script to support Swift projects. Add this to `scripts/init-project.sh`:

```bash
# Add Swift project type support
case $PROJECT_TYPE in
    "swift")
        echo "🍎 Setting up Swift console application"
        swift package init --type executable --name "$PROJECT_NAME"
        
        # Create enhanced .gitignore for Swift
        cat >> .gitignore << EOF
.build/
*.xcodeproj
.swiftpm/
EOF
        ;;
esac
```

## IndieDevHQ + Apple Workflow Integration

### **Daily Development Routine**

```bash
# Morning setup - update and validate environment
cd ~/Projects/MySwiftApp
git pull origin main
./scripts/check-conformity.sh .

# Development cycle
swift build                           # Build project
swift test                            # Run tests
./scripts/generate-docs.py .          # Update documentation

# End of day - commit and sync
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement feature X"
./scripts/sync-stories-to-issues.sh . false  # Sync to GitHub issues
git push origin main
```

### **GitHub Integration for Swift Projects**

```bash
# Set up complete GitHub automation for Swift project
./scripts/gh-automation.sh . MySwiftApp public

# Create Swift-specific GitHub workflows (enhanced CI/CD)
# This creates workflows that include:
# - Swift build and test
# - macOS compatibility checks  
# - Release automation for Apple platforms
```

## Advanced Apple Integration Features

### **Xcode Project Generation**

When needed, generate Xcode projects from Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
open MySwiftApp.xcodeproj
```

### **VS Code Integration**

Ensure VS Code is configured for Swift development:

```bash
# Install Swift extensions
code --install-extension swift-server.swift

# Open project in VS Code
code .
```

### **Testing and Quality Assurance**

Enhanced testing with IndieDevHQ quality checks:

```swift
// Tests/MySwiftAppTests/MySwiftAppTests.swift
import XCTest
@testable import MySwiftApp

final class MySwiftAppTests: XCTestCase {
    func testExample() throws {
        // Test core functionality
        XCTAssertEqual(2 + 2, 4)
    }
    
    func testCommandLineInterface() throws {
        // Test CLI functionality if applicable
        // Use swift-argument-parser testing utilities
    }
}
```

## Apple-Specific Templates

### **Swift Console App Template**

Create a template for Swift console applications:

```bash
# templates/swift-console/Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "{{PROJECT_NAME}}",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.2.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "{{PROJECT_NAME}}",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser")
            ]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "{{PROJECT_NAME}}Tests",
            dependencies: ["{{PROJECT_NAME}}"]
        )
    ]
)
```

### **Main.swift Template**

```swift
// templates/swift-console/main.swift
import ArgumentParser
import Foundation

@main
struct {{PROJECT_NAME}}: ParsableCommand {
    static let configuration = CommandConfiguration(
        abstract: "A utility for {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}",
        version: "1.0.0"
    )
    
    @Flag(help: "Enable verbose output")
    var verbose = false
    
    func run() throws {
        print("Hello from {{PROJECT_NAME}}!")
        
        if verbose {
            print("Verbose mode enabled")
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Swift Issues**
- **Build errors**: Check Swift version compatibility in `Package.swift`
- **Dependencies not resolving**: Clear `.build` directory and rebuild
- **Xcode integration**: Regenerate Xcode project after Package.swift changes

### **IndieDevHQ Integration Issues**  
- **Script permissions**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x scripts/*.sh`)
- **GitHub CLI**: Authenticate with `gh auth login` before using automation
- **Project detection**: Swift projects may need manual project type specification

## Integration with Other IndieDevHQ Components

### **AI Workflow Enhancement**
- Use Claude/ChatGPT for Swift code reviews and architecture decisions
- Leverage AI for SwiftUI layout and UIKit integration planning
- AI-assisted debugging and performance optimization

### **Documentation Integration**
- CLAUDE.md automatically generated with Swift-specific context
- Project documentation includes Apple development guidelines
- Cross-references to Apple Human Interface Guidelines

### **Quality Assurance**
- Conformity checks include Swift package structure validation
- Automated testing includes Swift-specific quality metrics
- Integration with Apple's testing and validation tools
