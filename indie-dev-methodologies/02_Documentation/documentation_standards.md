# 📚 Unified Documentation Standards & Strategy

> **Minimum Viable Documentation Stack** for AI-assisted software development with professional standards and templates.

---

## 🧠 Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Clarity First:** Write for humans and AI agents—concise, structured, and actionable
- **Token Efficiency:** Focus on structured, precise inputs rather than conversational overhead
- **Traceability:** Link stories, code, and decisions for easy navigation
- **Scalability:** Use modular docs and templates to grow with your project
- **Version Control:** All docs are tracked in Git for history and collaboration

### Key Goal
Point an IDE-based AI agent (like GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Cursor, etc.) to the *right* documents at the *right* times, using a clear, conventional structure.

## 🧱 Core Documentation Types

### Essential Documents (Start Here)

| Purpose | Document Type | When to Use with AI |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| What the software should do | **Requirements Document (PRD)** | Initial planning, AI feature brainstorming |
| How the system is structured | **Architecture Document** | AI code scaffolding, dependency management |
| Component-level behavior | **Technical Specification** | AI implementation guidance |
| Timeline and major goals | **Roadmap** | AI sprint planning, prioritization |
| Summary of the project | **README.md** | Always referenceable for any AI context |

### Supporting Documents

| Purpose | Document Type | AI Use Case |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| User-facing tasks and goals | **User Stories / Use Cases** | AI-driven UI/UX generation |
| Dev tasks broken down | **Backlog / Issue List** | AI auto-generation of tasks |
| API definitions | **API Spec (OpenAPI/Swagger)** | Generate or validate endpoints |
| Test cases for validation | **Test Plan / QA Checklist** | Generate unit/integration tests |
| High-level vision | **Vision Document** | Help AI keep long-term coherence |
| Risks and assumptions | **Risk Register** | AI decision-making tradeoffs |
| Architectural decisions | **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)** | Document and track key decisions |

## 📋 Milestone-Based Story Organization

### Why Milestones Work

| Problem | Solution via Milestone Grouping |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Too many user stories in one file | Stories are logically scoped to a version or phase |
| Hard to prioritize across contexts | Each milestone represents a focus block (sprint/release) |
| GitHub Projects clutter | GitHub supports milestone syncing for alignment |
| Teaching future-you gets harder | Preserves historical context ("our thinking for v0.3") |

### Milestone File Template

```markdown
# 🎯 Milestone [VERSION] – [NAME]

**Goal**: [Clear objective for this milestone]
**Target Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [Planning | In Progress | Complete]

## ✅ User Stories

### Story: [Feature Name]
**As a** [user type]  
**I want** [goal/desire]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Technical Notes:**
- Implementation approach
- Dependencies

## 🏷️ Tags
[comma, separated, tags]
```

## 🏗️ Core Templates

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template

```markdown
# ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Decision-makers:** [Names]

## Context and Problem Statement
[Describe the architectural problem that needs to be addressed]

## Decision Drivers

## 🤖 AI Integration Best Practices

### Feeding Documents to AI

1. **Context Setting**: Always include a brief system prompt
   ```
   "You are a senior developer. Use `tech_spec.md` to generate a Rust module implementing [feature]."
   ```

2. **Document Linking**: For LLMs without multi-file context, use summaries in a root file

3. **Metadata Usage**: Add YAML frontmatter for AI parsing
   ```yaml
   ---
   type: user_story
   milestone: 0.2
   status: in_progress
   tags: [api, authentication]
   ---
   ```

4. **Traceability Mapping**: Maintain story-to-code mapping
   ```markdown
   | Story ID | Files Modified | PR Link |
   |----------|---------------|---------|
   | US-001 | auth.rs, api.rs | #123 |
   ```

---

## 🔄 Documentation Workflow

### Creation Phase
1. Start with vision and requirements
2. Create architecture documents and ADRs
3. Break down into user stories by milestone
4. Generate technical specifications

### Implementation Phase
1. Reference docs in commit messages
2. Update docs as implementation evolves
3. Link PRs to user stories
4. Document decisions in ADRs

### Maintenance Phase
1. Regular documentation reviews
2. Update outdated sections
3. Archive completed milestones
4. Refactor for clarity
