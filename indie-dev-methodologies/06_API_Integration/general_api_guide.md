# 🔗 API Integration Guide (Anthropic, Claude, etc.)

> _Unified reference for integrating external AI APIs into your solo developer workflow._

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope
This guide consolidates all API integration strategies, focusing on Anthropic, Claude, and similar AI services. It covers:
- API setup and authentication
- Usage patterns and best practices
- Security and compliance considerations
- Integration with automation and documentation systems

---

## ⚡ API Setup & Authentication
- Register for API keys with Anthropic, Claude, or other providers
- Store secrets securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Document API endpoints and usage in `/docs/api_spec.yaml`
- Automate key rotation and access reviews

---

## 🛠️ Usage Patterns & Best Practices
- Use API calls for strategy, code generation, and documentation
- Rate limit requests to avoid throttling
- Log and monitor API usage for cost and performance
- Integrate API calls into automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use secure channels for API communication (HTTPS)
- Review provider compliance (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- Document API usage and risks in `/docs/risk_register.md`

---

## 🔗 Integration & References
- Link API integration to implementation and automation guides
- Reference API specs in documentation and architecture guides
- Cross-link risk register and compliance templates

---
