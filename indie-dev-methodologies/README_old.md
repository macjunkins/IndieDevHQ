# AI-Augmented Solo Developer Workflow

> **Orchestrating a toolbox instead of forcing a single tool to do everything** - This is how modern solo developers thrive with AI assistance.

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder contains a **consolidated knowledge base** for AI-augmented solo software development. The goal is to create a minimal yet powerful document structure that guides AI-assisted development while avoiding excessive documentation overhead.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> **No one tool does it all. Orchestrate a stack. Own your flow.**  
> Each tool in your ecosystem has a clear, focused role. You use the best of what each does without bloating or duplicating effort. AI fits into this stack as a force multiplier—not a full replacement.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### Core Files (Start Here)

| File | Purpose | Key Content |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **[01_workflow_overview.md](01_workflow_overview.md)** | Master system overview | Core philosophy, tool charter, Git strategy, folder structure |
| **[02_documentation_strategy.md](02_documentation_strategy.md)** | Documentation and organization | Minimum viable docs, milestone organization, AI usage tips |
| **[03_implementation_guide.md](03_implementation_guide.md)** | Technical implementation | Git traceability, automation scripts, GitHub Copilot integration |
| **[04_quality_assurance.md](04_quality_assurance.md)** | Process validation | Quality assessment, potential issues, feedback loops |

### Historical Context
- **[Conversation Summary - User Stories as Prompts & Integration Strategy.md](Conversation Summary - User Stories as Prompts & Integration Strategy.md)** - Historical evolution of the system (keep for reference)

## 🛠 Tool Charter

Each tool has a clearly defined role:

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **ChatGPT** | Strategy, architecture, planning, teaching doc |
| **Markdown docs** | Source of truth, version-controlled prompts |
| **GitHub Issues** | Task management + Copilot input |
| **GitHub Projects** | Development workflow + sprint board |
| **Cursor / Kilo** | Code generation, refactoring, and local AI agent |
| **Copilot (Issues)** | Optional agent for PR and subtask suggestion |
| **Apple Reminders** | High-level personal planner (30k ft strategy) |

## 🔄 The Meta-Loop System

```text
Vision / Requirements → User Stories → GitHub Issues
            ↓                     ↓
     Prompt AI agents → Generate code/tests
            ↓                     ↓
     Commit / PR / Feedback → Back to Stories
```

## 📁 Quick Start

1. **Read the overview** → `01_workflow_overview.md`
2. **Set up documentation** → `02_documentation_strategy.md`
3. **Implement automation** → `03_implementation_guide.md`
4. **Validate quality** → `04_quality_assurance.md`

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Reduced cognitive load** - 4 core files instead of 13 scattered notes
- **Clear information hierarchy** - Logical progression from overview to implementation
- **Easier maintenance** - Single source of truth for each concept
- **Better searchability** - Focused content in well-named files
- **Preserved insights** - All valuable content maintained, just reorganized

## 🚀 Consolidation Status

### Phase 1: Core Consolidation ✅
- [x] Create `01_workflow_overview.md` - Master system overview
- [x] Create `02_documentation_strategy.md` - Documentation and organization
- [x] Create `03_implementation_guide.md` - Technical implementation details
- [x] Create `04_quality_assurance.md` - Process validation and feedback
- [x] Update `README.md` - Reflect new structure and purpose

### Phase 2: Cleanup ✅
- [x] Delete redundant files (9 files removed)
- [x] Preserve historical context (1 file kept)
- [x] Update README to reflect final structure

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)
- [ ] Add cross-references between related concepts
- [ ] Create implementation templates for new projects
- [ ] Add tool-specific guides for each component in your stack
- [ ] Implement the CLI scripts mentioned in the implementation guide
- [ ] Create project templates for easy reuse across repositories

## 📌 Usage Notes

- **Copy this entire folder** into any new repository for instant workflow setup
- **Start with the overview** to understand the system before diving into details
- **Use milestone-based organization** to keep user stories manageable
- **Implement Git traceability** using the commit message conventions
- **Regular quality reviews** to ensure the system remains effective
