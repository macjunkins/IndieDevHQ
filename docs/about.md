# About IndieDevHQ

**AI-Augmented Solo Developer Methodology Framework**

IndieDevHQ emerged from the practical needs of solo developers seeking to harness AI tools effectively while maintaining professional development standards. Rather than replacing human expertise, this framework amplifies developer capabilities through systematic AI integration.

## Philosophy

### Tool Orchestration
**"No one tool does it all. Orchestrate a stack. Own your flow."**

IndieDevHQ focuses on orchestrating multiple tools rather than depending on any single solution. This approach ensures resilience, flexibility, and sustainable development practices.

### AI as Force Multiplier
AI tools serve as force multipliers for human creativity and expertise:
- **Strategic AI**: Claude/ChatGPT for architecture and planning
- **Tactical AI**: GitHub Copilot for inline code suggestions
- **Local AI**: Offline assistance for sensitive projects

### Documentation-First Development
Comprehensive planning and documentation capture knowledge and enable AI tools to provide better assistance through proper context.

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Contained Projects**: Each project maintains independent lifecycle
2. **Quality Standards**: Systematic validation and conformity checking
3. **Cross-Platform Native**: Focus on native user experiences
4. **Community-Driven**: Open methodology development and sharing

## Target Audience

- **Solo Developers**: Independent developers building applications
- **Small Teams**: Teams adopting AI-augmented workflows
- **AI Enthusiasts**: Developers exploring systematic AI integration
- **Quality-Focused Developers**: Those prioritizing maintainable, professional code

## Technology Stack

**Primary Platforms:**
- Swift + SwiftUI for Apple ecosystem
- Modern web frameworks for web applications
- Tauri + Rust for cross-platform desktop

**Development Environment:**
- macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel)
- VS Code/Cursor with AI extensions
