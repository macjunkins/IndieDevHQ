# IndieDevHQ

**Personal AI Development Infrastructure**

John's personal tooling and templates for AI-augmented development, focused on building useful applications (todge-tauri, ForgeDesk, etc.) with systematic AI integration while maintaining professional code quality.

## 🚀 Purpose

**Personal AI Development Environment**: Custom agent workflows, project templates, and automation scripts for productive solo development with AI assistance.

**📍 Repository:** https://github.com/macjunkins/IndieDevHQ

## Core Components

- **🤖 AI Agent Workflows**: Custom system prompts for development assistance (business mentor, project manager)
- **🎯 Project Templates**: Personal scaffolding for Tauri, Swift, and web applications
- **⚙️ Automation Scripts**: Personal productivity tools for repository setup and project initialization
- **📋 Development Templates**: GitHub issue templates and project structures for consistent workflow
- **🔧 Personal Tools**: Quality validation and conformity checking for professional code standards

## Technology Stack

**Primary**: Swift for Apple ecosystem applications (ForgeDesk, Cashly)
**Cross-platform**: Tauri + Rust for desktop applications (todge-tauri, phoenix-usb-flasher)  
**Web**: Modern frameworks for project documentation and interfaces
**AI Integration**: Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot workflows

## Key Scripts & Tools

Personal automation for efficient development workflow:

```bash
# Initialize new projects with full setup
./indie-dev-methodologies/scripts/init-project.sh MyApp tauri ~/Projects

# Validate repository quality and conformity  
./indie-dev-methodologies/scripts/check-conformity.sh ~/Projects/MyApp

# Set up GitHub repository with automation
./indie-dev-methodologies/scripts/gh-automation.sh ~/Projects/MyApp MyApp public
```

**AI System Prompts**: Business mentor (Jenny) and project manager (Jeff) for specialized development assistance

**Project Templates**: Scaffolding for consistent, professional project structure across Tauri, Swift, and web applications
