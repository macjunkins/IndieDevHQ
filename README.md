# IndieDevHQ

**AI-Augmented Solo Developer Methodology Framework**

A comprehensive community resource empowering indie developers to systematically integrate AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) as force multipliers while maintaining professional code quality and project organization standards.

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement (MKDocs Implementation)**  
Transforming into a professional, searchable documentation site for community adoption.

**📍 Repository:** https://github.com/macjunkins/IndieDevHQ  
**🌐 Documentation Site:** https://macjunkins.github.io/IndieDevHQ/ *(coming soon)*

## Core Features

- **📚 Methodology Framework**: Comprehensive AI-augmented development workflows
- **🎯 Project Templates**: Tauri, Swift, and web application scaffolding
- **🤖 AI Integration Patterns**: Strategic workflows for leveraging AI assistance
- **⚙️ Automation Scripts**: Repository setup, documentation generation, GitHub integration
- **✅ Quality Standards**: Conformity validation and best practices enforcement

## Technology Focus

**Primary**: Swift for Apple ecosystem, modern web frameworks  
**Secondary**: Tauri + Rust for cross-platform desktop applications  
**Documentation**: MKDocs with Material theme for professional community site  
**Future**: Linux systems integration planned

## Documentation Structure

The repository is being transformed into a structured documentation site:

```
