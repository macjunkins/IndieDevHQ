# IndieDevHQ Public Repository Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the necessary steps to transform the IndieDevHQ repository from its current local/personal workspace state into a public-facing community resource for indie developers.

## 🚀 Current Status (Updated: August 22, 2025)

**Repository:** https://github.com/macjunkins/IndieDevHQ  
**Phase:** 3 (Documentation Enhancement) - **IN PROGRESS** (2/9 completed - 22%)  
**Milestones Created:** 4 phases with due dates (GitHub Milestones 1-4)  
**Issues Created:** 31 total (9 for Phase 3, 19 for Phase 4, 3 for Phase 5, 3 for AI Ops)  
**Next Action:** Continue Phase 3 documentation work - 7 issues remaining

### Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** - Repository cleaned and published to GitHub
- ✅ **80 files committed** with 18,334+ lines of methodology content
- ✅ **Standard OSS files added** - LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ✅ **GitHub features configured** - Discussions enabled, topics added, templates created
- ✅ **Project management setup** - 4 milestones and 31 issues created for comprehensive tracking
- ✅ **Phase 3 Progress** - README.md (#1) and ROADMAP.md (#4) completed
- ✅ **Quality Improvements** - Bug fixes and automation enhancements ongoing

### ⏱️ Time Estimation Philosophy
**Target Audience:** Junior programmer unfamiliar with language/codebase  
**Methodology:** Hour-based estimates assuming learning curve and research time  
**Reality Check:** Experienced developers typically complete tasks 50-75% faster  
**Buffer Included:** Estimates include time for documentation, testing, and iteration

## Current Repository Status

### Issues Identified for Public Release

**Major Issues:**
1. **Personal Information in Content:**
   - System prompts contain personal names ("John" references)
   - Personal development documents and planning materials
   - Individual preferences and configurations

2. **Repository Structure Problems:**
   - Multiple nested git repositories within the main repo
   - Mixed personal and public content in same directories
   - Git configs pointing to personal repositories

3. **Content Scope:**
   - Personal PDFs and business planning documents
   - Individual IDE preferences and notes
   - Personal project references and examples

4. **Technical Issues:**
   - No GitHub remote configured for main repository
   - Untracked content directories (`dev-notebooks/`, `indie-dev-methodologies/`)
   - Missing standard open-source repository files

- All automation scripts functional
- Documentation complete and accurate
- No personal information exposed

**Community Metrics (Post-Launch):**
- GitHub stars and forks
- Community discussions and engagement
- Issue reports and contributions
- Adoption by other developers

## Risk Mitigation

**Data Loss Prevention:**
- Create backup of current repository state before modifications
- Use branches for major structural changes
- Test all changes in isolated environment

**Community Management:**
- Establish clear contribution guidelines
- Set up moderation for discussions and issues
- Prepare response templates for common questions

**Technical Risks:**
- Test all scripts in clean environment before launch
- Validate documentation accuracy with fresh perspective
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility of examples
