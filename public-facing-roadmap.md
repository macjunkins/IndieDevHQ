# IndieDevHQ Public Repository Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the necessary steps to transform the IndieDevHQ repository from its current local/personal workspace state into a public-facing community resource for indie developers.

## 🚀 Current Status (Updated: August 12, 2025)

**Repository:** https://github.com/macjunkins/IndieDevHQ  
**Phase:** 3 (Documentation Enhancement) - **IN PROGRESS**  
**Milestones Created:** 3 phases with due dates  
**Issues Created:** 12 total (6 for Phase 3, 6 for Phase 4)  
**Next Action:** Begin Phase 3 documentation work

### Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** - Repository cleaned and published to GitHub
- ✅ **80 files committed** with 18,334+ lines of methodology content
- ✅ **Standard OSS files added** - LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ✅ **GitHub features configured** - Discussions enabled, topics added, templates created
- ✅ **Project management setup** - Milestones and issues created for remaining work

### ⏱️ Time Estimation Philosophy
**Target Audience:** Junior programmer unfamiliar with language/codebase  
**Methodology:** Hour-based estimates assuming learning curve and research time  
**Reality Check:** Experienced developers typically complete tasks 50-75% faster  
**Buffer Included:** Estimates include time for documentation, testing, and iteration

## Current Repository Status

### Issues Identified for Public Release

**Major Issues:**
1. **Personal Information in Content:**
   - System prompts contain personal names ("John" references)
   - Personal development documents and planning materials
   - Individual preferences and configurations

2. **Repository Structure Problems:**
   - Multiple nested git repositories within the main repo
   - Mixed personal and public content in same directories
   - Git configs pointing to personal repositories

3. **Content Scope:**
   - Personal PDFs and business planning documents
   - Individual IDE preferences and notes
   - Personal project references and examples

4. **Technical Issues:**
   - No GitHub remote configured for main repository
   - Untracked content directories (`dev-notebooks/`, `indie-dev-methodologies/`)
   - Missing standard open-source repository files

**Step 2: Content Migration (6-10 hours)**
- Migrate existing content to structured docs format:
  - README.md → docs/index.md (rewrite as marketing/onboarding)
  - public-facing-roadmap.md → docs/roadmap.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md → docs/contribute.md
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md → docs/code-of-conduct.md
  - CLAUDE.md → docs/playbooks/prompting/claude.md
- Extract methodology content from `indie-dev-methodologies/` into docs structure
- Cherry-pick evergreen content from `dev-notebooks/` into docs/resources/

**Step 3: Content Enhancement (4-8 hours)**
- Create methodology template following established patterns
- Write AI integration patterns documentation
- Develop project templates for Tauri, Swift, and web apps
- Document automation scripts and GitHub integration guides
- Create quality standards and checklists

**Step 4: Site Optimization (2-4 hours)**
- Configure search and tagging system
- Set up navigation tabs and sections
- Add social links and GitHub integration
- Test local preview and build process

#### 3.4 Content Strategy (MKDocs-Optimized)
- **Community Framework Positioning**: Position as definitive resource for AI-augmented solo development
- **Searchable Knowledge Base**: Tag-based organization for easy discovery
- **Copy-Ready Content**: One method per page with actionable steps
- **Tool-Agnostic Approach**: Focus on patterns and principles over specific tools
- **Quality Standards**: Consistent methodology template with quality checklists

#### 3.5 GitHub Pages Deployment

- Phase 4: READY (12-18h estimated) - Due: Aug 17, 2025  
- Phase 5: PLANNED (8-12h estimated) - Due: Aug 19, 2025

**Note:** Time estimates assume junior programmer unfamiliar with codebase/tools. Experienced developers may complete tasks 50-75% faster.

## Success Metrics

**Launch Metrics:**
- Repository successfully public and accessible
- All automation scripts functional
- Documentation complete and accurate
- No personal information exposed

**Community Metrics (Post-Launch):**
- GitHub stars and forks
- Community discussions and engagement
- Issue reports and contributions
