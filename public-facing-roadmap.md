# IndieDevHQ Public Repository Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the necessary steps to transform the IndieDevHQ repository from its current local/personal workspace state into a public-facing community resource for indie developers.

## üöÄ Current Status (Updated: August 12, 2025)

**Repository:** https://github.com/macjunkins/IndieDevHQ  
**Phase:** 3 (Documentation Enhancement) - **IN PROGRESS**  
**Milestones Created:** 3 phases with due dates  
**Issues Created:** 12 total (6 for Phase 3, 6 for Phase 4)  
**Next Action:** Begin Phase 3 documentation work

### Recent Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** - Repository cleaned and published to GitHub
- ‚úÖ **80 files committed** with 18,334+ lines of methodology content
- ‚úÖ **Standard OSS files added** - LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ‚úÖ **GitHub features configured** - Discussions enabled, topics added, templates created
- ‚úÖ **Project management setup** - Milestones and issues created for remaining work

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimation Philosophy
**Target Audience:** Junior programmer unfamiliar with language/codebase  
**Methodology:** Hour-based estimates assuming learning curve and research time  
**Reality Check:** Experienced developers typically complete tasks 50-75% faster  
**Buffer Included:** Estimates include time for documentation, testing, and iteration

## Current Repository Status

### Issues Identified for Public Release

**Major Issues:**
1. **Personal Information in Content:**
   - System prompts contain personal names ("John" references)
   - Personal development documents and planning materials
   - Individual preferences and configurations

2. **Repository Structure Problems:**
   - Multiple nested git repositories within the main repo
   - Mixed personal and public content in same directories
   - Git configs pointing to personal repositories

3. **Content Scope:**
   - Personal PDFs and business planning documents
   - Individual IDE preferences and notes
   - Personal project references and examples

4. **Technical Issues:**
   - No GitHub remote configured for main repository
   - Untracked content directories (`dev-notebooks/`, `indie-dev-methodologies/`)
   - Missing standard open-source repository files

- Phase 5: PLANNED (8-12h estimated) - Due: Aug 19, 2025

**Note:** Time estimates assume junior programmer unfamiliar with codebase/tools. Experienced developers may complete tasks 50-75% faster.

## Success Metrics

**Launch Metrics:**

- All automation scripts functional
- Documentation complete and accurate
- No personal information exposed

**Community Metrics (Post-Launch):**
- GitHub stars and forks
- Community discussions and engagement
- Issue reports and contributions
